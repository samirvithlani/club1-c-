stl:stl is c++ template library provide  common programming data structurs, and functions
it is contains algorithms, containers, iterators, and function objects

containers: containers are used to store data
vector
set
map
list
deque
stack

algorithms: algorithms are used to perform operations on containers
sort
find
copy
count
accumulate
transform

iterators: iterators are used to iterate over containers
begin
end

function objects: function objects are used to perform operations on containers
less
greater
equal_to
logical_and
logical_or
logical_not


vector: vector is used to store data in a sequential manner
vector is a dynamic array : it can grow and shrink in size
vector is a template class
vector is a container
vector is a sequence container : it stores data in a sequential manner
vector is a contiguous container: it stores data in a contiguous manner
contiguous manner: data is stored in a single block of memory
vector is a random access container : it can be accessed using random access iterators
