OOPS 4 concepts
A: Encapsulation
    class and object
    data hiding
    
    constructor,destructors

    constructor is special function which has same name as class name:
    use of constructor is to initiize instance variable of class and to allocate memory to object
    constructor does not have return type

    type of constructor:
    1) default constructor
    2) parameterized constructor
    3) copy constructor

B: Inheritance

C: Polymorphism
    overloading and overriding
D: Abstraction
    abstract class and interface

class : 
def: class is a user defined data type,
which holds its own data members and member functions,
which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

-> class is group of data members and member functions

-> class is blueprint of object

object :
def: object is an instance of class
object is an entity / identity of class

fruit class apple object
Vehicle class car object

building --> school   student/teacher

to create class in c++ we have class keyword
